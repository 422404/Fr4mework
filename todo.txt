Order of priority:

- /!\ Unit testing /!\

- test Router, Route, Link

- implement @Singleton, @StrictSingleton and singletonify()

- add state management
    <MobX>
        * values are updated by actions and can lead to rerender (@triggerRender)
        * actions are declared inside stores (@actions)
        * computed values are computed whenever a value of the store changes (@computed)
    </MobX>

- readme files
- implement dependency injection (like Angular 1.x)

( - maybe get rid of typescripts for the tests ... )


Unit testing :
  100% passing
