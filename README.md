# Fr4mework
It pronounses framework and not fr-four-mework...
It's a micro-framework I'm building for educationnal purpose. It's far from good as of now and will not be good in the future.
It helps me learn Typescript, the Virtual DOM thingy and reactive programming.

The fr4mework is heavily inspired by React and even more by Hyperapp, the state management is inspired of MobX and hope to build some horrific hybrid.
