# Fr4mework
It pronounces framework and not fr-four-mework...<br />
It's a micro-framework I'm building for educationnal purpose. It's far from good as of now and will not be good in the future.<br />
It helps me learn Typescript, the Virtual DOM thingy and reactive programming.

The fr4mework is heavily inspired by [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and even more by [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp), the state management is inspired of [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) and I hope to build some horrific hybrid (not at this [level](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/visual-basic/) anyway).
